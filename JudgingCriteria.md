# Judging Criteria

Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project. 

- **Social Good:** Does the project address a social or civic problem? Does the project have an educational or interactive component that is likely to have some kind of impact on the problem it is trying to address?

- **Technology:**  How technically impressive was the project? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique, or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"? 
- **Design:** Did the team put thought into the user interface? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?). 
- **Completion:** Did the team achieve everything they wanted? Is the team satisfied with what was accomplished in the 24 hours? 

- **Learning:**  Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? Did the project go outside of their in-school curriculum? Did non-technical members learn any coding skills?
- Useability: Does the end product seem like it will be useful? Is it easy to use? Was thought put into how a user would use their solution?

These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving. 

It's important to note that these judging criteria do not include: 

- How good the code is. It doesn't matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn't production ready, we're not going to mark you down. 
- How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling. 

- How good the idea is. Again, hackathons aren't about coming up with innovative ideas. It's about building and learning. 
- How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you're learning and having fun, that's a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks! 

On a final note, have fun with what you are doing. Do not be pressured on coming up with the next big thing. Have fun with your project and learn something new. Work on something you find fascinating. You will have plenty of time outside of this hackathon to come up with the next big creation.
